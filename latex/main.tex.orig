\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

Quantum networking represents a transformative advancement in secure communication, 
with Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and the quantum internet standing at its core. 
Unlike the widely available and adopted classical systems, QKD leverages certain mechanical principles
from the field of quantum physics in order to theoretically guarantee unbreakable encryption schemes, 
addressing critical vulnerabilities in modern cryptographic methods. 
In the dawn of its rise, quantum internet promises a global network enabling unprecedented levels of 
secure communication, distributed quantum computing, and advanced scientific applications.

\chapter{Introduction}

Quantum networking stands as the next frontier in communication technology,
which is expected to leverage principles of quantum mechanics for
achieving unprecedented levels in security, as well as in computational capability. 
In contrast to ordinary classical networks, quantum networks rely on quantum states 
of the likes of superposition and entanglement to achieve operations impossible for
the classic networking schemes. 
These attributes become of vital importance in application areas like secure communications, 
where quantum key distribution (QKD) promises provable security against eavesdropping, 
and in distributed computing in cases where quantum nodes could 
collaborate to solve problems beyond the reach of classical networks. 
In the modern world, where the requirement for global data security keeps following 
an increasing trend, quantum networking is considered as a robust solution 
for protecting sensitive informations.
Also  mixed architectures combining classical and quantum networks
in novel frameworks could lead into much more efficient, applications... 

%#############################################
Challenges arise although; despite the promising potential in quantum networking,
it faces technical and theoretical obstacles that need to be surpassed 
in order to achieve and enable an entirely practical implementation and adoption.
Because of the very nature of quantum mechanichs, quantum internet is opted to utilize concepts
without classical counterparts with the likes of quantum entanglment, 
no-cloning theorem, quantum measurement and teleportation. 
In the classical and well known model of computation experienced so far, 
we deeply rely on the fact that information can be read and copied, a concept that does not hold
for quantum networking. The scalability remains one of the main issues, 
because as current quantum networks are limited in the number of nodes and the 
distances they can span without degradation. 
This limitation comes from the fragile nature of the quantum states,
which are very sensitive on environmental noise and decoherence especially over long distances. 

As a countermeassure the developments of reliable quantum repeaters 
and advanced error-correction schemes are 
required to break these barriers. Additionally, 
the efficient generation, distribution, 
and storage of entanglement across a network pose critical hurdles, 
as maintaining high fidelity in entangled 
states is necessary for the network's functionality. 
Another key challenge lies in integrating 
quantum systems with classical infrastructure, 
which requires seamless coordination between 
vastly different operational paradigms. 
Addressing these challenges is crucial for moving quantum 
networking beyond the experimental 
phase and into real-world applications.
The computing power of a quantum computer is exponentialy 
related to the number of qubits that comprise it; where a qubit is the quantum 
counterpart of the classical bit and is the building block of a quantum computers.

\section{BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol}

BB84 protocol is a foundational work in the field 
of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols,
been proposed back in 1984 \cite{bb84}.
It realizes a secure communication of a secret cryptographic key
alongside two entities, over an insecure medium/channel 
by using principles of quantum mechanics.
