\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}

In this presented application, as a real use case of neural networks,
utilizing their property of predicting among different classes after 
an appropriate training phase, neural networks have been used in order
to classify network traffic on an automotive channel (CAN Bus) as normal
or intrusion(DOS attack).

\chapter{Introduction}

DNA sequence assembly is a key task in genomics, enabling breakthroughs across a vast application field,
including medical research, evolutionary biology, synthetic biology, foresnic investigation, metagenomics and agriculture \cite{wikiDNASEQASS}
Results provided by this process allows researchers to get usefull insights into life's complexity.
The goal of DNA sequencing assembly is to provide the ability of reconstructing an original genome from a
partially fragmented overlapping versions of itself obtained through sequencing technologies. 
It holds a critical role for the decoding the genetic information of organisms enabling in better understanding
of biological functions and  mechanisms underlying evolution, health and disease. 
With the rapid evolution of sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and long-read platforms, 
have generated vast amounts of data, necessitating efficient and accurate assembly algorithms to piece together fragmented sequences.
There are two types in the process of DNA sequence assembly: the de novo assembly, which is the reconstruction of a genomes without having any
reference of the original gemone, 
and the reference-based assembly, where the original genome is known and the fragmented genome parts have to be aligned with the reference sequence. 
In this report we exploted and implemented an application for DNA sequence assembly by integrating a solution for traveling salesman problem with
a genetic algorithm approach using a reference-based method.

\chapter{Methodology}
 

 Related to the methodology followed in our project, the work of \textit{Nalecz et al.} \cite{Nalecz}  was
 examined, and implemented in a similar way the 
 distance matrix used for the DNA assembly. 
 Also as a complementary material, the study of 
 of \textit{Varsamis et al.} 
 \cite{VARSAMIS2023105037}, have provided a helpful 
 example for understanding better the nature of the
 problem even if our implementation did not
 followed the graph walk proposed by them.
